The only thing that I have done wrong is to win an election that was expected to be won by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. The problem is they forgot to campaign in numerous states!,08-23-2018 00:56:35

Michael Cohen plead guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime. President Obama had a big campaign finance violation and it was easily settled!,08-22-2018 13:37:34
A large number of counts ten could not even be decided in the Paul Manafort case. Witch Hunt!,08-22-2018 13:34:16
I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family. ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù took a 12 year old tax case among other things applied tremendous pressure on him and unlike Michael Cohen he refused to ‚Äúbreak‚Äù - make up stories in order to get a ‚Äúdeal.‚Äù Such respect for a brave man!,08-22-2018 13:21:29
